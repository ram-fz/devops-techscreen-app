This is sample basic web app, with Nodejs and Mongo running in two separate containers. There are also 2 extra containers consisting of Prometheus and Grafana. 

Your job is to run docker-compose and ensure if: 
 - the web is working as intended? 
 - if Prometheus is running?
 - if Grafana is running?
 - if Prometheus is configured in such a way that it can get metrics from `node` and `mongo` containers? If not, do what you need to do to ensure these containers logs show up in Grafana and document what you did.
